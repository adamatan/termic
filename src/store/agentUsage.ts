// same quota must read the same number, and two tasks on different quotas must
// never see each other's, so the key has to be exactly the thing the provider
// bills: the login.
//
// The account half arrived with the switcher (GH #278) and it was a real
// defect for the window in between. Before accounts, an agent entry WAS a
// login: holding a second one meant cloning the agent and relocating its
// config dir, so keying by entry id alone was correct and this file said so.
// Once one entry can hold several accounts that stopped being true, and two
// tasks of the same agent on different logins wrote into one slot: whichever
// spoke last painted its percentage under the other's name. Nothing failed,
// nothing looked wrong, and the number was somebody else's.
//
// The account in the key is the one the PROCESS was spawned with (Rust returns
// it from `pty_spawn`), never the one currently configured. A switch applies
// on the next spawn, so between the click and the restart those two differ,
// and the configured one would file the old account's spending under the new
// account's name.
