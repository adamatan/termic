// When to move a task onto another account, and which one (GH #278).

// Pure functions, no store and no ipc, for the same reason `accountPill.ts` is:
// this repo tests logic rather than rendered output, and these rules ACT on the
// user's behalf. A wrong answer here does not misdraw a chip, it silently
// spends the wrong subscription.
//
// The whole feature rests on one honest limitation: a switch takes effect on
// the NEXT spawn, because a running process cannot have its environment
// changed underneath it. So this never rescues the turn in flight. What it
// does is make sure that when the user restarts the agent (which a spent
// account forces them to do anyway) they are already on an account that can
// serve them, instead of hitting the same wall a second time and only then
// going looking for the switcher.
