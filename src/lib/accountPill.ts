 *  named it, so the pill would have to invent a label, which is the "Default
 *  forever" trap the profiles chip avoids by not existing yet.
 *
 *  It was TWO, on the grounds that one account is nothing to switch between.
 *  That was wrong in use: naming a credential set is the moment the user
 *  starts thinking in accounts, and the footer staying empty afterwards reads
 *  as the feature not having worked. The pill also carries "add another",
 *  so at one account it is the thing that gets you to two. */

 *  word "Client".
 *
 *  `next` is NOT printed. It briefly was, as `Work -> Client`, and two names
 *  in a footer chip read as a state nobody asked about; picking an account now
