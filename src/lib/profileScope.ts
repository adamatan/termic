// Per-profile localStorage namespacing (GH #280).
//
// Every profile window is a webview on the SAME origin, so localStorage is
// shared between them whether we want it or not. Anything keyed by task UUID
// is already safe (UUIDs are disjoint across profiles); anything keyed by a
// name, a project id or nothing at all is silently global and has to be
// namespaced by hand.
//
// The namespace is the WINDOW LABEL, which is available synchronously. That
// matters more than it looks: stores read their keys at module-init time, so
// an async `invoke("profiles_list")` would be too late and every store would
// boot from the wrong profile's state for a frame.
//
// The root profile's keys are UNPREFIXED, deliberately. Its label is `main`,
// which maps to the empty namespace, so an existing install's collapse state,
// folder colors and prompt library are read from exactly the keys they are
// already in. No migration, and no user notices anything.
//
// What is NOT scoped, and must not be: preferences. Theme, fonts, terminal
// settings, editor settings and shortcut bindings are machine-level in
// docs/plans/profiles.md's scope table ("muscle memory does not change per
// identity"), so they stay on their bare keys and are shared by every window.

/// The window label, read once. Falls back to the root namespace outside a
/// Tauri window (vitest, and the `activity.html` entry).
