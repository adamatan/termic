// The footer's one source of truth for "which account is this task on"
// (GH #278).
//
// A hook rather than a fetch inside each chip, because the account pill and
// the usage chip are two views of ONE fact and they were wrong about it in two
// different ways when each fetched for itself:
//
//   - the pill's opt-in checkbox and the usage popover's opt-in checkbox are
//     the same setting, so toggling one left the other showing the old value
//     until something happened to remount it. Caught by an e2e case that
//     toggled it in one place and read it in the other.
//   - the usage chip keys its reading by account, so it needs exactly the
//     account the pill is naming, and a second fetch is a second chance to
//     disagree.
//
// One fetch, one refresh, both chips.
