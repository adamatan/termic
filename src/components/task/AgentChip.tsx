// ONE chip, not two. The account pill used to sit immediately left of this
// with its own trigger and its own panel, and its own header said it "forms
// one unit" with the usage chip, because the numbers here are THAT account's
// numbers. Two controls that form one unit are one control: merging them
// answers "which account, and how much is left" in a single click, and
// removed a duplicated auto-switch checkbox that had already caused one
// two-panels-disagree bug.
//
// Subscription usage in the task footer (GH #277).
//
// Two numbers per account, a fill bar, and the agent's own brand icon. It sits
// immediately left of the sandbox status, which stays the rightmost item, and
// it shares that row with the "N blocked" chip, so it is deliberately terse.
// The detail lives in a popover, which is a CLICK: the numbers are what you
// read at a glance, the reset clocks are what you go looking for.
//
// Where the numbers come from differs per agent and is invisible here: claude
// pushes them through its status line on every turn, codex is asked over
// JSON-RPC. See docs/ideas/usage-footer.md.
